	<dd>An work in progress IRC client that is mostly discontinued at this point unless I have the time to work on a project for fun again. Written in C using the GTK+3 toolkit. Needs an overhaul of some of the code (specifically the networking code) to make better use of glib and GIO, along with implementing some necessities like a send buffer. This project mostly served however, as a way to teach myself how managing a large project would work, along with teaching myself how to program fluently in C and the GTK+ toolkit.</dd>
