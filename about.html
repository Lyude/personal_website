		<h1>About Me</h1>

		<h2>What is this?</h2>
		<p>
			This is my personal homepage. It serves to give a good idea of who I am, showcase my work, and look good for employers. My online alias is Lyude, but my real name is Stephen Chandler Paul (call me Chandler though :).
		</p>

		<h2>Well then, what do you do?</h2>
		<p>
			Most of my spare time is spent programming. Specifically on the Linux platform. I have recently been trying to dabble in open source projects.
		</p>

		<h2>What's the best way to contact you?</h2>
		<p>
			Although I'll usually respond on all of my messengers, the most reliable method is by e-mail, since almost all of my devices will go off if I receive a message there. You can send me an e-mail at <a href="mailto:thatslyude@gmail.com">thatslyude@gmail.com</a>.
